# COVID-WA-LSTM
Creating an LSTM to predict how many deaths there will be on a given day, 
based on previous days with a time lag. I am currently using the past 10 days.

NOTE: This LSTM is not entirely complete yet, I still have to do some hyperparameter optimization.

I am using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/fireballbyedimyrnmom/us-counties-covid-19-dataset
